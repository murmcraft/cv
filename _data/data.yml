career-profile:
    title: Summary
    summary: |
      I am molecular biologist by training, but during my PhD I specialized in 
      high-throughput DNA sequencing and conducted the projects **from mouse dissections 
      to automated bioinformatic data analyses**. 
      My current position as a full-time bioinformatician has further introduced me 
      to human genetics, development of high-performance computing pipelines and 
      cloud environment. **I am highly motivated to work on DNA sequencing, 
      data quality control, pipeline development and automation as well as 
      testing and documentation**. 

      Furthermore, the bioinformatic work has sparked **irreversible interest in programming**: 
      on my free time I participate in Girl's coding club, Mimmit koodaa events or 
      online courses to learn e.g. Python, SQL and HTML. 
      I've applied my newly acquired skills to develop my own small apps and to build my

    - degree: MSc (Tech. with Distinction) in Environmental Biotechnology and Food Microbiology
      university: Tampere University of Technology

experiences:
    - role: Bioinformatician
      time: 2017 - Present
      company: FinnGen Sequencing Informatics Team, FIMM
      details: |
        Currently I work as a bioinformatician in [FinnGen project][]{:target="_blank"}. 
        We develop and test genotype data processing and analysis workflows 
        for high-throughput computational pipelines required to genotype 500 000 Finns. 
        
        My tasks focus on whole genome sequencing (WGS) and 
        chip genotype **data quality control** and data formats as well as 
        **developing and testing** the outcomes and behavior of **imputation pipeline modules**. 
        Additionally, I work on mitochondrial genotype data quality control.

    - role: Doctoral student
      time: 2014 - 2017
      company: Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing, Cologne, Germany
      details: |
        My PhD projects focused on **detection of mouse mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) variants with next-generation sequencing (NGS)**.
        I optimized the mtDNA extraction and Illumina HiSeq sequencing protocols such that it was possible to 
        reliably identify extremely rare variants. For reproducibility, **I scripted the data analysis into an automated pipeline**. 

        The method was applied in projects utilizing mtDNA mutator mouse model to
          - identify mitochondrial genome regions essential for replication and transcription
          - clarify the developmental timing of mtDNA purifying selection 
          - understand the effect of mtDNA variants on mtRNA processing.

    - role: Research Assistant
      time: 2011 - 2013
      company: Department of Food Hygiene and Environmental Health, University of Helsinki
      details: |
        I studied cold tolerance and gene regulation mechanisms of food-borne pathogens (Biosafety level 2). 
        I utilized various growth conditions, created mutant strains and measured the cold tolerance in
        microarray and qPCR experiments. I conducted both sides of the projects - **the lab work and the data 
        analysis in R**. The projects were reported in two publications and as my master's thesis.
